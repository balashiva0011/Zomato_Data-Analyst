## Description

This project uses Zomato restaurant data to analyze various restaurant features such as ratings, online orders, table bookings, cost, and type of cuisine. The data is analyzed using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The insights gained from the analysis can help in understanding customer preferences, restaurant popularity, and identifying patterns in the restaurant business.

### Key Insights:
- What factors contribute to high ratings and votes?
- How do different restaurant types (e.g., buffet, fine dining) compare?
- The distribution of restaurant prices and ratings across regions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains restaurant data such as:
- **Name**: Name of the restaurant.
- **Online order**: Availability of online orders (Yes/No).
- **Book table**: Availability of table booking (Yes/No).
- **Rate**: Restaurant rating (out of 5).
- **Votes**: Number of votes received by the restaurant.
- **Approximate cost for two people**: Estimated cost for a meal for two.
- **Listed in (type)**: The type of dining experience (e.g., Buffet, Casual Dining, etc.).

You can find the dataset in the `data` folder (or any other location if hosted externally).

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing data, remove duplicates, and handle inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use Python to analyze trends, distribution, and correlations in the dataset.
- **Visualizations**: Generate plots such as bar charts, pie charts, and histograms to visualize data insights.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform correlation and hypothesis testing to understand relationships between features.
